Welcome to SIPVicious security tools.

This stuff is obviously still very betaish.

The 3 tools that you should be looking at are:
 - svmap
 - svwar
 - svcrack

The tools:
svmap - this is a sip scanner. When launched against
ranges of ip address space, it will identify any SIP servers 
which it finds on the way. Also has the option to scan hosts 
on ranges of ports.

svwar - traditionally a war dialer used to call up numbers
on the phone network to identify ones that are interesting from
ones that are not. With SIP, you can do something similar to 
identify active users. 

svcrack - this is a password cracker making use of digest
authentication. It is able to crack passwords on both registrar
servers and proxy servers. It can make use of ranges of numbers
or a dictionary file full of possible passwords. 

For usage help make use of -h or --help switch.

and if you're stuck you can always contact the author.
