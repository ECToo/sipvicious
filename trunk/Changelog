v0.1-svn
General:
* added iphelper.py which will eventually replace ip4range

Svmap:
* Feature: Host arguments now accepts a variety of formats. You can now scan using ranges like the following:
	- 1.1.1.1-20 1.1.1-20.1-10
	- 1.1.1.*
	- 1.1.1.1-1.1.2.20
* Bug fix: Generation of hosts to scan is now dynamic and does not slow down startup time
* Feature: Now making use of the standard logging module with more logging to debug problems
* Feature: Verbose and Quite mode
* Feature: When the port is already bound, svmap tries to listen on another port
* Feature: Reverse DNS resolution for IPs that reply back
* Feature: Added options to allow you to specify the ip to bind to as well as the external ip address of the scanner
* Feature: --help now shows proper usage
* Feature: ReportBack function is off by default but can be enabled by using -R option
* Feature: New scanning method - random. This scan avoids scanning non-internet address space. 
Svwar:
* Bug fix: Handled bug which allowed svwar to miss valid extensions (false negatives)
* Bug fix: Logic bug which did not identify between a server that does not respond and one that sends an unexpected response.
