Welcome to SIPVicious security tools.

The 3 tools that you should be looking at are:
 - svmap

The tools:
svmap - this is a sip scanner. When launched against
ranges of ip address space, it will identify any SIP servers 
which it finds on the way. Also has the option to scan hosts 
on ranges of ports.

svwar - identifies working extension lines on a PBX. 
Also tells you if the extension line requires authentication or not. 

svcrack - a password cracker making use of digest authentication. 
It is able to crack passwords on both registrar servers and proxy 
servers. Current cracking modes are either numeric ranges or
words from dictionary files.
