#summary The list of features or fixes which we'd like work on

= general = 
  * verbose levels or use logging module better ;)

= svmap =
  * optimization: check why scanning port ranges is so slow
  * optimization: check why windows is slow while other unix-like OSes are fine
  * work more on fingerprinting

= svwar =
  * scan multiple hosts at the same time
  * might make sense to integrate this with svmap

= svcrack = 
  * optimization: check when was the last response - if it were more than a few seconds ago then inform the end user and maybe reduce speed
  * feature: end user to scan multiple users
  * feature: intelligent scan - sequentially perform the following attacks:
        * username and modifications of that as password
        * numeric bruteforce
        * dictionary attack
        * alphanumeric bruteforce
