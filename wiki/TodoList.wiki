#summary The list of features or fixes which we'd like work on

= general = 
  * feature: verbose levels or use logging module better ;)

  * optimization: check why windows is slow while other unix-like OSes are fine
  * feature: work more on fingerprinting
  * feature: -iR option ;)

= svwar =
  * feature: scan multiple hosts at the same time
  * feature: might make sense to integrate this with svmap

  * optimization: check when was the last response - if it were more than a few seconds ago then inform the end user and maybe reduce speed

  * feature: intelligent scan - sequentially perform the following attacks:
        * username and modifications of that as password
        * numeric bruteforce
