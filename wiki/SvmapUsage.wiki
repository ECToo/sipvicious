#summary How to use svmap.

= Svmap usage =

Svmap is a free scanner for auditing of sip devices and PBX servers. The tool is flexible enough to allow you to scan ranges of ip addresses as well as ranges of ports for SIP. It accepts comma delimited files, and can output to comma delimited files as well. Can be used to launch different types of scans, including ones that set

usage: svmap.py [options]

options:
  --version             show program`s version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o output.csv, --output=output.csv
                        Output results to a specified csv file
  -i input.csv, --input=input.csv
                        Input csv based on previous results
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  Destination port or port ranges of the SIP device - eg
                        -p5060,5061,8000-8100
  -P PORT, --localport=PORT
                        Source port for our packets
  -t SELECTTIME, --timeout=SELECTTIME
                        Timeout for the select() function. Change this if
                        you're loosing packets
  -c, --enablecompact   enable compact mode. Makes packets smaller but
                        possibly less compatable
  -m METHOD, --method=METHOD
                        Specify the request method - by default this is

= Details =

== Output ==
The purpose of having an output file to csv format is to be able to import the results in spreadsheet and database applications with ease. A security administrator or penetration tester might want to present results in graphs.

This also serves the purpose of being compatible with the input option.

== Input ==
The input option accepts csv files with the same format as the output option. It serves the purpose of being able to scan specific devices on specific ports. This allows security testers to scan the same devices at different times using different methods. 

One particular usage example is to scan for SIP devices using default options. Then at a given time scan for the SIP devices found in the previous scan using the INVITE method, which can get all the scanned devices to ring at the same time.
