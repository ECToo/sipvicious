#summary How to use svwar

= Introduction =

Svwar is a free SIP PBX extension line scanner. In concept it works similar to traditional wardialers by guessing a range of extensions or a given list of extensions.

Svwar can:
  * identify extensions on PBXs and through SIP proxies
  * Scan for large ranges of numeric extensions
  * Scan for extensions using a file containing a list of possible extension names
  * Use different SIP request methods for scanning since not all PBX servers behave the same
  * resume previous scans

= Svwar Usage =
{{{
usage: svwar.py [options] target
examples:
svwar.py -e100-999 10.0.0.1
svwar.py -d dictionary.txt 10.0.0.2


options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity
  -q, --quiet           Quiet mode
  -s NAME, --save=NAME  save the session. Has the benefit of allowing you to
                        resume a previous scan and allows you to export scans
  --resume=NAME         resume a previous scan
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  destination port of the SIP UA
  -t SELECTTIME, --timeout=SELECTTIME
                        timeout for the select() function. Change this if
                        you're losing packets
  -d DICTIONARY, --dictionary=DICTIONARY
                        specify a dictionary file with possible extension
                        names
  -m OPTIONS, --method=OPTIONS
                        specify a request method. The default is REGISTER.
                        Other possible methods are OPTIONS and INVITE
  -e RANGE, --extensions=RANGE
                        specify an extension or extension range  example: -e
                        100-999,1000-1500,9999
  -z PADDING, --zeropadding=PADDING
                        the number of zeros used to padd the username.
                        the options "-e 1-9999 -z 4" would give 0001 0002 0003
                        ... 9999
  -c, --enablecompact   enable compact mode. Makes packets smaller but
                        possibly less compatable
  -R, --reportback      Send the author an exception traceback. Currently
                        sends the command line parameters and the traceback
  --force               Force scan, ignoring initial sanity checks.

= Target =

Svwar requires the user to pass a target, which can either be an ip address or a destination hostname. 

Examples:
{{{
./svwar 10.0.0.1
}}}

To specify a hostname instead of the IP:
{{{
./svwar siphost.com
}}}

= Options =

== Save ==
The save option allows users to store the current session properties to a database. You can then make use of svreport to manage the sessions and export to other formats. Refer to SvreportUsage page for this.

Example:
{{{
./svwar -s session1 10.0.0.1
}}}

This also serves the purpose of being compatible with the input and resume options.

== Resume ==
Resumes a previously incomplete session. To list sessions make use of "svreport.py list". When a session is saved, svwar will periodically save the current state and also save the state upon exit.

{{{
./svwar --resume session1
}}}

== Destination port ==
By default, most SIP devices listen on the udp port 5060. However some SIP phones might listen on a high port. Make use of svmap to scan for ports which speak SIP on a target address. You can then pass the non-standard port to svwar by specifying "-p" option. 

{{{
./svwar -p5061 10.0.0.1
}}}
