= v0.2.4 =
  * Feature:  svwar.py can now scan for templated numbers. This allows more flexible usage of ranges of numbers, allowing for prefixes and suffixes as need be ;-)
  * Bug fix:  svwar.py now sends ACK to be nice to other devices.
  * Bug fix:  each tag is padded with a unique 32 bit
  * Bug fix:  Contact header is always added to the request to always send well formed SIP requests          
  * Bug fix:  Large data is sent fragmented now (mysendto)
  * Bug fix:  svwar.py now handles new SIP response codes


= v0.2.3 =

  * Feature: Fingerprinting support for svmap. Included fphelper.py and 3 databases used for fingerprinting.
  * Feature: Added svlearnfp.py which allows one to add new signatures to db and send them to the author.
  * Feature: Added DNS SRV check to svmap. Use ./svmap.py --srv domainname.com to give it a try


= v0.2.svn =

  * Feature: added the ability for svreport to count results when doing a list
  * Bug fix: fixed a bug related to resuming a scan which does not have an extension

= v0.2.1 (maintenance) =

== General ==

  * Feature:  updated the report function to include more information about the system. Python version and operating system is now included in the bug report. option now supports optional feedback.

  * Feature:  Store information about the state of a session. Sessions can be complete or incomplete, so that you can resume incomplete sessions but not complete ones.

  * Feature:  Added -e option to svmap. Allows you to specify an extension. This is useful when using -m INVITE options on a SIP phone.

  * Bug fix:  Added a check to make sure that the python version is supported. Anything less than version 2.4 is not supported

  * Bug fix:  IP in the SIP msg was being set to localhost when not explicitly set. This is not correct behavior and was fixed. As a result of this behavior some devices, such as Grandstream BT100 were not being detected. Thanks to robert&someone from bulgaria for reporting this

  * Bug fix:  fixed a bug in the database which was reported anonymously via the --reportback / -R option. Thanks whoever reported that. Bug concerns the dbm which does not support certain methods supported other database modules referenced	by anydbm. Reproduced on FreeBSD. Thanks to Anthony Williams for help i dentifying this

  * Bug fix:  Ranges of extensions in svwar could not take long numeric extensions (xrange does not support long / large numbers). Thanks to Joern for reporting this

  * Bug fix:  svwar was truncating extension names containing certain characters. Fixed.

  * Bug fix:  when binding to a specific interface, the IP within the SIP message could be incorrect (when there are multiple interfaces). This has been fixed.

  * Cosmetic: Certain PBXs reply with "603 Declined" when svwar finds that the extension does not exist. This creates extra noise. It is now being suppressed.
