v0.2-svn
General:
* Bug fix:  fixed a bug in the database which was reported anonymously via the --reportback / -R option.
            Thanks whoever reported that. Bug concerns the dbm which does not
	    support certain methods supported other database modules referenced
	    by anydbm.
* Bug fix:  Ranges of extensions in svwar could not take long numeric extensions
            (xrange does not support long / large numbers).
* Bug fix:  svwar was truncating extension names containing certain characters. Fixed.
* Cosmetic: Certain PBXs reply with "603 Declined" when svwar finds that the
            extension does not exist. This creates extra noise. It is now being
	    suppressed.
